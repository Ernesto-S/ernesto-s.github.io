    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Ernesto Salcedo and I am a first generation Latino engineering graduate. I grew up in a low income household in the central valley and I helped my family by working in the fields at age 11. I felt the pain of having a labor intensive job and when I turned 18 I decided to pursue higher education at CSU Sacramento. When I was choosing my major, I remember thinking that I liked math and that I didn't want to work in the fields ever again. After looking at the list of majors I was attracted to Electrical and Electronics Engineering and I started my journey. It wasn’t easy but I persevered. The years went by and my interest varied from biomedical, control systems and electronics. It wasn’t until the last year at college that I explored electives like machine vision and robotics and I was hooked. I realized then that it was programming that excited me. I had little to no experience since programming was not part of my curriculum. When I programmed on Arduino I was able to get things to work, but I did not have a good foundation which led to several sleepless nights. After I graduated, I looked for positions relating to machine vision, robotics, or control systems. I was able to land a Process Engineer role at a Lidar company and I continued pursuing programming. I had a positive impact by helping manufacture the future of machine vision and I shared my experience and knowledge with my peers. Unfortunately, I have been let go from that company due to COVID-19. Now, I want to gain a solid programming foundation and I believe Coding Dojo will help me reach this goal. I want to join the future of AI/Robotics/Sensing and continue helping others.
